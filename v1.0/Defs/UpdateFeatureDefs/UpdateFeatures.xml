Update 2.3.8

Giant Skeletons have improved texture art courtesy of Trisscar!

New Need: Travel - pawns with this need enjoy being in caravans and get a mood boost when they've traveled frequently, but acquire a mood penalty when they remain at a colony too long

New standalone fighter ability - Legion: this ability allows any fighter to learn a single fighter ability from any other fighter class (except faceless)
New standalone fighter ability - Tempest Strike: by burning through their stamina reserves, the pawn uses their equipped weapon to launch a flurry of attacks; works with ranged and melee weapons

Two new minor classes have been added; these classes do not have class abilities but can improve generic abilities learned via scrolls
    * Pawns with the Gifted or Physically Adept traits can immediately promote to their respective minor classes
    * Minor classes cannot be promoted to a full class at a later time

Class - Wanderer (mage): excels at general abilities but has no class abilities
    * can teach themselves to use basic fighter abilities
    * their caravan ignores tile movement penalties
    * enjoys traveling and has the need to travel
    
Class - Wayfarer (fighter): excels at general abilities but has no class abilities 
    * can teach themselves to use basic mage abilities
    * increases the speed of their caravan by 25%
    * enjoys traveling and has the need to travel
    
Class - Chaos Mage (mage): a unique class that possesses only one class skill: Chaos Tradition. Using this skill, the chaos mage can acquire the skills of any other class    
    * Chaos Tradition: reveling in their freedom from class restrictions, the chaos mage cycles the abilities they have available to use
    * Blood magic, necromancy, and master spells are unobtainable
    * Chaos mages are subject to a unique phenomenon (wild surge) that can randomly create chaotic effects whenever a chaos mage uses magic
